# CS50x 2024 - Problem Sets and Final Project

This repository contains my solutions for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science.  
Throughout the course, I explored foundational concepts in computer science, including:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Memory management and pointers
- Web development fundamentals
- Low-level programming with C
- Programming with Python, SQL, and Flask
- Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Cybersecurity principles and an introduction to artificial intelligence

## A Quick Word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/)

While my solutions are provided for each problem set, it is crucial that you make your best effort to figure out a working solution yourself before looking at any answers. There are many great communities for support, such as:
- [CS50 Stack Exchange](https://cs50.stackexchange.com/)
- [CS50 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/?rdt=37147)
- [CS50 Slack](https://cs50x.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2vg3xv6jr-6o9OGdQeSJIl0gf20MhBLQ#/shared-invite/email)

### Final Project

**Water Reminder Chrome Extension**

For my final project, I developed a Chrome extension designed to help users stay hydrated throughout the day. Key features include:
- Personalized hydration goals and reminder intervals
- Daily progress tracking with motivational notifications
- The ability to mute reminders when needed

The extension was developed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Chrome's `manifest.json` to structure the interface, handle notifications, and manage hydration goals dynamically. This tool promotes healthier habits in a simple, engaging, and intuitive way, ensuring users never forget to take a sipâ€”whether they're working, studying, or going about their day.
