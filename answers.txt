If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I'd characterize their audio aura by computing the average of energy, valence and danceability from the songs in songs.db.
Then, based on this attributes, I'd say:
- For energy: A high average would mean the user's aura is more intense and lively while a low average would mean the user's aura is chill, calmer.
- For valence: A high average would mean the user's aura is happy, while a low would mean the user's aura is melancholic
- For danceability: A high average of danceability would mean the user's aura is beat-driven, while a low means not beat-driven


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

It might not be very representative because it doesn't take into consideration how often each song is played.
A song played more times should have a greater impact on the user's aura, as well as a song played less times should have a smaller impact.
Therefore, I think a better way of calculating this aura would be weighting the songs based on its play count.
I also think it should incorporate the other attributes already in songs.db, such as tempo or speechiness, into the calculations.
With that, you can create a more accurate aura for the user.
