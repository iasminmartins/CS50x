# CS50x 2024 - Problem Sets and Final Project 
This repository contains my solutions for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science. 
Throughout the course, I explored foundational concepts in computer science, including:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Memory management and pointers
- Web development fundamentals
- Low-level programming with C
- Programming with Python, SQL, and Flask
- Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Cybersecurity principles and an introduction to artificial intelligence
  
A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/):

While my solutions are provided for each problem set, it is crucial that you make your best effort to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any answers. There are many great communities for support and help, such as [CS50 Stack Exchange](https://cs50.stackexchange.com/), the [CS50 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/?rdt=37147), and the [CS50 Slack](https://cs50x.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2vg3xv6jr-6o9OGdQeSJIl0gf20MhBLQ#/shared-invite/email), to name a few.

    ### Water Reminder Chrome Extension
    For my final project, I developed a Chrome extension designed to help users stay hydrated throughout the day. Key features include:
    - Personalized hydration goals and reminder intervals
    - Daily progress tracking with motivational notifications
    - The ability to mute reminders when needed
    
    Developed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Chrome's manifest.json to structure the interface, handle notifications, and manage hydration goals dynamically.
  
    [Explore the project here](https://github.com/iasminmartins/CS50x/tree/cs50/problems/2024/x/project)
    
    This extension promotes healthier habits in a simple, engaging, and intuitive way, ensuring users never forget to take a sipâ€”whether they're working, studying, or going about their day.

## How to Run
For the Water Reminder chrome extension installation (final project):  
1. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.  
2. Enable Developer Mode.  
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project's folder.
     
To run any of the other solutions:
1. Clone the repository and switch to the desired branch:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iasminmartins/CS50x.git
   cd CS50x
   git checkout <branch-name>
